Hi Everyone!

I am a mechanical engineer that is interested in all sorts of Computer Science stuff.
I love to pretend i am a programmer.
Building "Hello World"'s since 2019.
I know every programming language good enough to create a variable.
My favorite languages: Haskell, Python, JavaScript (yes JavaScript)
